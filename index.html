                        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
                        <p>During the day, I work full time as a nurse. At night, I'm an aspiring software engineer and developer. Thanks to Thinkful, I am currently focusing on internet technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Being able to bring
                            ideas to life that don't require a command line, or a separate package for GUIs has been a fun (and at times, frustrating) experience. While I admit to not being the greatest designer for the front end portion of full stack
                            development, it provides an interesting challenge (not unlike gaming). It's also rewarding to be able to strengthen a weakness of mine. I'm also pretty fond of gaming and psychology. A bit of a far cry from programming, but
                            it's good to be (not so) well rounded.
                        </p>
